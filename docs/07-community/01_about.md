Join us in this jurney to build a package orchestrator server for KRM packages.

pkgserver was started and currently maintained by Nokia with the clear target to make the project community driven.

The functionality of pkgserver overlaps with [Porch](https://github.com/nephio-project/porch) and have the potential to replace Porch in the [Nephio](https://docs.nephio.org/) architecture.

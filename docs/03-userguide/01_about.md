# UserGuide

In the userguide we show a number of scenario how the `packageserver` would be used to manage packages.

The pkgserver project offers two primary methods for interacting with the `pkgserver`:

- Using `kubectl`, the main Kubernetes CLI tool, allows users to explore the packageserver API in a generic manner.

- Alternatively, users can utilize the `pkgctl` CLI, a dedicated tool specifically designed as a wrapper around the `pkgserver` API. pkgctl provides additional capabilities, such as presenting content in a more user-friendly format and enabling local editing and exploration of package content.

In the various sections of the user guide we will explain both options with its capabilities.
